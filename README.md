# Http to MySQL
## What's this?
A small flask (python) script, to convert regular Http requests to MySQL commands.
You should be able to read the functions and I recommend to finetune the script a little.
## Requirements
- Running flask dev- or production server
- jsonpickle module
- Basic MySQL and flask knowledge
